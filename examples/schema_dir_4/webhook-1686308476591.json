Kubernetes provides a set of default roles where RBAC is used. Some of these roles such as cluster-admin provide wide-ranging privileges which should only be applied where absolutely necessary. Roles such as cluster-admin allow super-user access to perform any action on any resource.

When used in a RoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the rolebinding's namespace, including the namespace itself.","remediation":"Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role.
